# 🔀 ProxyOnlineLinker

## 🌐 Overview

**ProxyOnlineLinker** is a plugin designed to link online player counts between proxies and servers in
Minecraft. It supports multiple server types
including [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/), [BungeeCord](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bungeecord/), [Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity),
[TransferProxy](https://github.com/YvanMazy/TransferProxy), making it a versatile solution
for server administrators looking to manage player counts effectively across different platforms.

## ✨ Features

- **Multi-Platform Support**: Compatible with Spigot, BungeeCord, Velocity and TransferProxy servers.
- **Highly configurable**: Configure sources, cache, update intervals, and more.
- **Performant**: Lightweight and optimized for performance.

📚 Consult the [wiki](https://github.com/YvanMazy/ProxyOnlineLinker/wiki) for more information.

## 📥️ Installation

1. Download the latest version of ProxyOnlineLinker from the Releases page.
2. Place the downloaded `.jar` file into the `plugins` folder of your server.
3. Start or restart your server to generate the configuration files.
4. Modify the `config.yml` file to suit your server's needs.

## ❓ Use cases

Linking the number of connected users can be useful in cases where you have multiple servers that are not directly
hosted by the same proxy. In a multi-proxy environment, or simply for independent projects hosted by the same
organization.
Finally, the project was initially designed for [TransferProxy](https://github.com/YvanMazy/TransferProxy), a project
that uses packet transfers to redirect players
without holding the connection. ProxyOnlineLinker can therefore also be used for projects that use packet transfers.
